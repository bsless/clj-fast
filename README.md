# clj-fast

Faster idiomatic Clojure.

## What is it?

Low level Clojure can go a long way, given some assumptions.

Clojure is highly expressive and quite abstract. This, combined with
immutability has a knock-on effect on performance. In most cases, it
does not matter, either because performance isn't an issue, or because
our problems lie somewhere else.

This library is for the other set of cases, sticking as close to
Clojure's API while offering significant performance boosts.

Inspired by [Naked Performance (with Clojure) â€“ Tommi
Reiman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SSHjKT3ZmA).

## Why

### Production

When the need arises to improve performance, there can be tension
between writing idiomatic or even legible code and performance.

clj-fast provides measurably faster implementations which do not
sacrifice idiomatic Clojure style.

The immediate target is not the every-day application developer, but the
library author who wants to offer the best performance possible, or the
developer tasked with optimizing specific pieces of code.

### Education

Serve as a reference guide and handbook on performance characteristics,
implementation methods, optimization opportunities and benchmark
methodologies in Clojure.

## How

The biggest gain observed repeatedly is via loop unrolling, to an
extensive degree.

In some cases, significantly more performance can be gained by
dispatching to concrete classes instead of via `clojure.lang.RT`.
Macros and code generation in general are used extensively in the
library.

They don't compose as well as functions, _caveat emptor_.

> So you're saying Clojure is badly implemented? That it's just slow?

No.

Plenty of Clojure's core functions are implemented to be generic (good)
and to accept a variable number of arguments (also very good). 
Abstraction and flexibility come at the cost of performance. Iteration
and dynamic class dispatch have a cost. Take a look at Clojure's core
namespace once and see how many basic functions are implemented using
iteration with `next` and `rest`.

Plenty of these behaviors are just forms of flow-control, and like `and`
and `or`, other forms of flow control can too be statically analyzed,
under certain constraints, and replaced by faster code.

## When

When should this library be used? It depends.

As a general advice, _don't_ require `clj-fast.clojure.core`, refer
`all` and replace core functions without understanding the implications.

The library contains building blocks and provides some higher level
constructs built with them. In most cases, I believe using the
`clj-fast.inline` namespace to be sufficient.

Use it in your library if you feel you must provide the best performance
you can and don't want to hand craft all the low level code yourself.

Use it in your application if you must and have exhausted all other
options besides rewriting it in another language. This is after you
profiled it, analyzed it, and know where your problems are. When all you
have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Fix all other problems
first.

## Latest Version

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/bsless/clj-fast/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/bsless/clj-fast)

## Results

See [results.md](extra/clj-fast.analysis/doc/results.md) for experiments' detailed benchmark results.

## Usage

### Requirements

Add in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[bsless/clj-fast "0.0.10"]
```

WARNING: Due to a bug in leiningen, versions built prior to `0.0.9` will pull in extra dependencies. Make sure to upgrade!

### Functions and Macros

#### Fast(er) Functions

```clojure
(require '[clj-fast.core :as fast])
```

- `entry-at`: used like `find` but doesn't dispatch and has inline
  definition. Works for `IPersistentMap`.
- `val-at`: used like `get` but doesn't dispatch and has inline
  definition. Works for `IPersistentMap`.
- `fast-assoc`: Used like `assoc` but doesn't take variable key-values,
  only one pair and has inline definition. Works on `Associative`.
- `fast-map-merge`: Slightly faster version for `merge`, takes only 2
  maps.
- `rmerge!`: merges a map into a transient map.


#### Inline Macros

```clojure
(require '[clj-fast.inline :as inline])
```

Like regular core functions but sequence arguments must be written
explicitly for static analysis or `def`ed in advance (i.e. `resolve`-able).

Examples:

```clojure
(def ks [:a :b])

(inline/assoc m :a 1 :b 2)

(inline/dissoc m :a :b)

(inline/fast-assoc m :a 1 :b 2)

(inline/get-in m ks)

(inline/get-in m [:c :d])

(inline/get-some-in m [:c :d])

(inline/assoc-in m [:c :d] foo)

(inline/assoc-in m [:c :d] foo [:c :b] bar)

(inline/update-in m [:c :d] inc)

(inline/select-keys m [:a :b :c])

(inline/merge m1 m2 m3)

(def assoc* (inline/memoize-c 3 assoc))
```

##### Notes

- Merge analysis unrolls inline maps as well.
- Warning: additional arities of assoc-in will cause code reordering.
  Beware of side effects.

##### Additions

- `fast-assoc`: inlines in the same manner of `assoc` but uses
  `clj-fast.core/fast-assoc` instead.
- `fast-map-merge`: inlines in the same manner of `merge` but uses
  `clj-fast.core/fast-map-merge` instead (Metosin).
- `fast-select-keys`: like `select-keys`, but faster and dirtier, adds
  nil entries to the results map.
- `get-some-in`: Like `get-in` at the expense of working only on callables
  (objects implementing `clojure.lang.IFn`).
- `find-some-in`: like `get-some-in` but returns a map-entry in the end,
  like `find`.
- `memoize*` & `memoize-c*`: Alternative implementations for memoization
  using a nested Clojure hash map and a nested Java concurrent hash map
  respectively. Fall back to `core/memoize` for large arities. Due to
  the cost of hashing objects in Clojure, it's recommended to use
  `memoize-c*` for most use cases.

#### Bypass dynamic dispatch with type hints

The `get` and `nth` macros operate similarly to their respective
functions with one notable difference: When provided with an appropriate
type hint, they will dispatch to the underlying method at compile time
instead of run time.

```clojure
(def arr (long-array [1 2 3]))
(nth ^longs arr 0)
(def m (doto (java.util.HashMap.) (.put :a 1)))
(get ^Map m :a)
```

#### Collections

##### HashMap

```clojure
(require '[clj-fast.collections.hash-map :as hm])
```

- `->hashmap`: wraps `HashMap`'s constructor.
- `get`: wraps method call for `HashMap`'s `get`. Has inline definition.
- `put`: wraps method call for `HashMap`'s `put`. Has inline definition.

##### ConcurrentHashMap

```clojure
(require '[clj-fast.collections.concurrent-map :as chm])
```

- `->concurrent-hash-map`: constructor.
- `concurrent-map?`: instance check.
- `put!?`: `putIfAbsent`.
- `get`
- `get?`: get if is a concurrent hash map.
- `get-in?`: like clojure core's get-in but for nested concurrent hash maps.
- `put-in!`: like clojure core's assoc-in but for nested concurrent hash maps.

#### Lenses

```clojure
(require '[clj-fast.lens :as lens])
```

In typed functional programming, lenses are a generic way of getting
and setting nested data structures (records).

In this context, the `lens` namespace implements the basic code structure
underlying Clojure's `get-in`, `some->`, `assoc-in` and `update-in`.
They can be used in macros to expand to real code provided an appropriate
1-depth `get` and/or `put` transformer, which takes arguments and returns
an expression.

For example, the `get-some` lens is used to define `inline/get-some-in`:

```clojure
(defmacro get-some-in
  [m ks]
  (lens/get-some (fn [m k] `(~m ~k)) m ks))
```

Similarly, for `assoc-in`:

```clojure
(defmacro assoc-in
  [m ks v]
  (lens/put
   (fn [m k v] `(c/assoc ~m ~k ~v))
   (fn [m k] `(c/get ~m ~k))
   m
   (u/simple-seq ks)
   v))
```

So be careful, these are not functional programming lenses, but
metaprogramming lenses used for code generation.

## Rewriting Core Functions And Macros

The namespace `clj-fast.clojure.core` contains drop-in replacement
functions and macros for Clojure's core.

It opportunistically replaces functions by their inlined
implementations. It also includes binding macros (let, fn, loop, defn)
which will use inlining versions of `get` and `nth` when possible. (i.e.
when type-hinted).

### Usage

```clojure
(ns com.my.app
  (:refer-clojure
   :exclude
   [get nth assoc get-in merge assoc-in update-in select-keys memoize destructure let fn loop defn defn-])
  (:require
   [clojure.core :as c]
   [clj-fast.clojure.core :refer [get nth assoc get-in merge assoc-in update-in select-keys memoize destructure let fn loop defn defn-]]))
```

## General Note Note On Performance And Profiling

Profiling and performance measurements on the JVM are not an exact
science.
The variety of contributing factors and their possible interactions are
far from all being accounted for.

Still, one of the most significant factors is the JVM's JIT compiler.

It is absolutely essential where performance is concerned.

Some tools such as Leiningen suppress the JIT to enable faster start-up
times. While this is desirable in a development environment, it must be
properly configured for profiling or production tasks.

The JVM's configuration settings can be examined by evaluating:

```clojure
(into [] (.getInputArguments (java.lang.management.ManagementFactory/getRuntimeMXBean)))
```

If you see `TieredStopAtLevel=1` or any number below 4 you're
essentially running without aggressive JIT on.

With Leiningen, make sure to either use a different profile or override
the `:jvm-opts` to get the best performance possible and realistic
profiling results.

### Specific note on performance and clj-fast

If you intend to use it in your library or application, make sure you
profiled it first and know where your issues are.

- Use [clj-async-profiler](https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler)
- Use [criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium)
- Use [JMH](https://github.com/jgpc42/jmh-clojure)
- Use VisualVM

These are powerful tools. I used them when building this library. Any
performance problem should first *measured*.

joinr (Tom) which provides more efficient destructuring macros with type
hints.

### Stringer

[Stringer](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/stringer) is a library by
Shantanu Kumar for fast string operations. Of interest are the
capabilities it provides in faster string building and formatting, also
by "unrolling" the building operations where statically possible.
