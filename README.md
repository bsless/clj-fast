# clj-fast

Library for playing around with low level Clojure code for performance reasons
given some assumptions.
Inspired by [Naked Performance (with Clojure) – Tommi Reiman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SSHjKT3ZmA).

Some of the code is based on implementations in metosin's projects. Credit in code.
